Problem Statement:
As web applications proliferate, they increasingly become targets for cyberattacks that exploit
vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), insecure authentication, and
outdated libraries. While large organizations can afford dedicated security resources, small to mid-
sized development teams often lack the expertise or tools to conduct comprehensive security
evaluations. This gap results in widespread exposure of web applications to preventable attacks,
posing risks to both users and businesses.

Proposed Solution:
The project will develop WebSecScan, an automated, lightweight security scanner tailored to identify
common web application vulnerabilities. By leveraging both static code analysis (examining source
files like HTML and JavaScript) and dynamic behavioral analysis of web applications, WebSecScan
will systematically detect issues using recognized vulnerability databases (such as the OWASP Top
10). The tool will feature an intuitive interface to facilitate adoption and integration within typical
development workflows, empowering teams to incorporate security checks early and often.

Expected Outcome:
WebSecScan will yield practical, actionable vulnerability reports that developers can use to enhance
the security of their applications before deployment. By lowering technical barriers and automating
security analysis, the tool is expected to promote secure coding practices, reduce the prevalence of
common vulnerabilities across web projects, and contribute to a more secure web ecosystem,
especially benefiting teams with limited cybersecurity resources.
