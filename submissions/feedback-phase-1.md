Phase 1 Evaluation – 

Overall Evaluation

The Phase-1 submission demonstrates a clear understanding of the cybersecurity challenges faced by modern web applications and provides a well-defined concept for an automated vulnerability-scanning tool. The student effectively articulates the motivation behind the project, emphasizing the gap in security resources available to small and mid-sized development teams. The proposed solution is realistic, relevant, and technically aligned with widely recognized security frameworks such as the OWASP Top 10.

The project is appropriate for Phase 1 and establishes a strong foundation for the development phases that will follow.

Problem Statement – Evaluation

The problem statement is clear, relevant, and well-formulated. It identifies the rising threat landscape surrounding web applications and highlights the lack of security expertise in many organizations.
The explanation of threats—SQL injection, XSS, insecure authentication, outdated dependencies—is accurate and demonstrates awareness of common vulnerabilities.

Strengths:

Captures an important real-world problem
Aligns with industry security standards
Addresses an underserved audience (small to mid-sized teams)
Areas for refinement:

Could briefly mention regulatory or business impact (e.g., data breaches, compliance issues) for added depth.
Overall: Strong and precise problem framing.

Proposed Solution – Evaluation

The proposed solution is technically sound and demonstrates thoughtful planning. The integration of both static and dynamic analysis shows maturity in understanding modern security scanning approaches. Leveraging recognized vulnerability databases (OWASP Top 10) is an excellent design decision.

Strengths:

Clear identification of core scanning processes
Balance of static and dynamic analysis
Practical, lightweight, developer-friendly tool concept
Strong justification for usability through an intuitive interface
Areas for refinement:

Clarify whether the tool will perform crawling, payload generation, or rely only on rule-based checks.
Mention expected constraints such as performance limits or scope boundaries.
Overall: Excellent, feasible technical solution concept.

Expected Outcome – Evaluation

The expected outcome is well articulated and aligns correctly with the vision of an MVP. It outlines the intended impact on development workflows and the advantages of automated reporting.

Strengths:

Emphasis on actionable vulnerability reports
Focus on supporting developers with limited security expertise
Clear link between project goals and broader ecosystem security benefits
Areas for refinement:

Could include how success will be measured (e.g., detection accuracy, coverage).
Mention potential export formats or report structure only if already planned.
Overall: Clear, realistic, and achievable outcome definition.
