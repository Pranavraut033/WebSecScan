## 1. TOPICS AND TASKS

A significant part of computer science is the development of machines that efficiently map an input (the problem) to an output (the solution). The machine is a computational device that uses one or many methods to transform input to outputs. Computer scientists are in the business of developing appropriate and efficient methods (processes, software, algorithms, hardware) that solve problems.

How do we apply computational methods in the real world? In reality, we are using computational methods for almost all aspects of life, especially in those areas where automation can make our lives easier. We build machines to increase efficiency of otherwise tedious, manual problems. Call centers use voice recognition algorithms to securely identify a customer over the phone using voice biometrics. Voice recognition in this use case automates several minutes of conversation between a customer service agent and the customer to verify the customer's identity. Face ID simplifies the authentication time for a user logging into a smartphone.

To do so successfully, computer scientists invent tools, such as programming languages or compilers, that tend to have sophisticated algorithmic foundations. These tools evolve as people start using them. For example, object-oriented programming started with a simple question: instead of using “types” as prescribed by the programming language, can a programmer implement their own types (i.e. classes)? Do we need compilers, or can we build a program once that will run on any other system (interpreters)? Can we build a method that can process sound signals such that a voice identification system will take a few seconds to assign a unique identifier to a human voice rather than 30?

The real world is complex and computer science strives to find elegant, repeatable solutions to solve complex problems. The aforementioned topics are merely examples. This project allows you to think of a real-world problem worth solving. The choice of project is yours. You can think of investigating problems that have already been solved and dig deep into the computational machines and methods used to solve a particular real-world problem. Or you can investigate a problem you care about deeply and attempt to solve it using the tools of computer science.

### 1.1. Task

**Task:** Apply computer science techniques to a real-world problem of your own choice. Select and work on a problem that inspires you. The goal is to present an in-depth research report on how you addressed the solution to the problem. You are expected to implement some part of your solution by either developing code or providing a mathematical analysis of your solution or both.

To decide on the exact scope of your project you first need to investigate the context of the area you want to work in. Subsequently, it is advisable to break down the problem into a smaller number of appropriately difficult problems and use the project as a vehicle to explore solutions to them.

We expect you to competently use advanced concepts and methods as you have learned them in your 1st semester master’s program. For example, a project that contains an exposition of a recent development in data science should contain an original presentation of the relevant theory in your own words, e.g. with an interesting, new example or helpful notation.

There are no constraints to your creativity. The main deliverable is a research report.

Work on your problem in the following 3 phases:

#### 1.1.1. Conception phase

This phase is for you to settle on a project idea. Think about an interesting problem that you might have encountered in real life and ask yourself if there is a clever technology solution you could explore. Or think about an interesting solution that you experience in your daily life and always wondered how it actually works.

**Deliverable for Phase 1:**  
An abstract, not more than ½ of a DIN A4 page (approx. 200 words). This abstract illustrates the problem you want to address, how you want to address it, and what you expect the outcome to be.

- Submit on PebblePad as a PDF no longer than ½ of a DIN A4 page. The text field in the PebblePad template remains empty.
- Use online tutorials for feedback before submission.

#### 1.1.2. Development phase/reflection phase

This phase is for you to get started on addressing the selected problem. Decide on the appropriate technology (programming language, libraries, etc.) to develop your solution idea.

**Deliverable for Phase 2:**  
A draft of your research report. The project report should be considered a technical document readable by a computer scientist who is not a specialist in this topic. The structure could be as follows:

- Abstract (revision of concept phase deliverable)
- Introduction (explain the problem or the context)
- Related work (who else has looked at the problem and what did they find)
- Technical background (technical underpinnings)
- Method (method you are using to solve the problem)
- Implementation (how you implemented the solution)
- Testing (how you verified your solution works)
- Conclusion (summary and further work)
- Bibliography and references

If you develop code, create a public GitHub repository and post your code assets there (recommended, not mandatory at this stage). If you develop a mathematical analysis, mention this in your Method section.

- Submit your draft report on PebblePad as a PDF. Submit the link to your GitHub project in the PebblePad text field.

#### 1.1.3. Finalization phase

In the finalization phase (Phase 3), complete your research report after receiving feedback from the tutor. Improve or change elements as needed.

**Deliverables for Phase 3:**

- Abstract (reflecting on the process, max 2 pages)
- Final research report (max 30 pages, including references and GitHub link)
- Upload a zip folder containing:
    - 01-research_report (your research report)
    - 02-code (code assets as a zip export of GitHub repo)
- Include all images and fonts used in your document in the respective directory.

**Submission:**  
1. Upload your abstract as a PDF file in PebblePad.  
2. Attach the research report as a PDF file with a link to your public GitHub repository.  
3. Export your GitHub repository as a ZIP file and upload it to your submission in PebblePad.

## 2. TUTORIAL SUPPORT

Several channels are open for feedback on the portfolios. Use online tutorials for feedback on each phase. The tutor is available for technical, formal, and general questions. Technical questions regarding PebblePad should be directed to the exam office via mail.
